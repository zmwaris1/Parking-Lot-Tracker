# Parking-Lot-Tracker

I created this vehicle parking lot project with the OOP concepts using python.

The project consists of the following:

There are 40 spots available in the parking lot, with two levels as 'A' and 'B'.

One class named : ParkingLotTracker.

# Details

Methods used:

1. Constructor method - Initializes the parking spots and a dictionary for already parked vehicle details. Default size is 40.

2. registerVehicle - Vehicle id is given to register the vehicle for parking and a spot is assigned automatically to the vehicle.

3. _assignSpot - assigns parking spot to the vehicle.

4. getDetails - provide details for the parked vehicle i.e the level and the spot of parking. E.g {level: 'A', spot: 19}.

5. emptySpot - empties the already used spot if the vehicle is removed. Add the spot back to the list of parking spots. Also displays the empty spots in the lot.
